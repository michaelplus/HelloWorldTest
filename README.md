README
=======

This project is very simple and was created to understand the ins and outs of Git and GitHub, including how to collaborate on GitHub.

Instructions
-------------
For someone new to GitHub, creating an account is the first step. There is a walk-through that guides a new user in downloading the GitHub native app and getting started working on projects.

Some useful resources:

* [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started) is the first chapter of a good reference for understanding what version control is, what Git is, what GitHub is, and how to use it.
* [https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) is a great explanation of Markdown, the formatting language used for GitHub README files.

Note: This README may not show up in the native Windows 8 GitHub app; see [this Stack Overflow fix]( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21110011/windows-github-app-not-detecting-readme/21273024#21273024).
